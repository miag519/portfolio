      <h1>Mia Garcia's CS Project Portfolio</h1>      
      <p>Some of my interests include art, music, personal development, reading, and dance. I tend to use a more artistic approach; I love sketching and painting, or doing anything creative in general. What I like most about CS is having the ability to make whatever you want happen, and the feeling of accomplishment when it works! One of my strengths is that I love problem solving and use it as a challenge to motivate myself more.</p>

        <p><a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1490664" target="_blank">Link to project</a></p>
        <p>Here I used differen't vertex points and straight lines to create my origami art. Including shadowing and multiple designs and angles.</p>

        <p><a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1451000/embed/" target="_blank">Link to project</a></p>
        <p>Here I used translating, rotating, and so much more to place my shapes in the desired spot for the astronaut I was displaying. I used stroke and coloring for some dimension. JS was also used so that the user could add stars by the click of their mouse, even though they pop up automaticaly! (This is actually one of my first projects getting into code)</p>

        <p><a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1584210 " target="_blank">Link to project</a></p>
        <p>Here me and my partner, Axel Hurtado, created different mazes as levels with a default spawn and a final destination. We made the walls send you back to the start if touched by the ball you're moving. There are 2 levels until you reach the end screen!</p>

        <h4>Basic animation</h4>
        <p><a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1551494" target="_blank">Link to project</a></p>
        <p>In this project I designed the elements first, including the whale tail, sun, and the ocean. The proceeded to use JS code to make the tail and sun move automatically and at different speeds on start.</p>

        <p><a href="https://dsw-templates-example-1-ygrj.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Website</a></p>
        <p>Here I used python code to print out the data the user inputs in different ways to create different username options. HTML and CSS code was used to make it look nice.</p>

        <p><a href="https://miag519.github.io/study-quiz/" target="_blank">Website</a></p>
        <p>Here I used HTML and CSS code to make the quiz pleasing to look at, as well as JS code to help with the functionality of it. The Js code changes the elements of the answers the user clicks to determine if they got it correct or incorrect. There is a button at the end to see the answer key.</p>

        <p>Here, get and post was introduced and creating different pages for the quiz was done. After you answer the questions you're not able to go back and change them unless you restart, and you see your score at the end. </p>
